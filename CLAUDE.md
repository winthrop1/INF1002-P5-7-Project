cd INF1002-P5-7-Project

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```

### Running the Web Application
```bash
python website.py
```
The application will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000 with debug mode enabled.

### Testing Email Classification

#### Using Current Implementation (Recommended)
```python
from email_manage import parse_email_file
from suspiciouswords import classify_email
from domainchecker import domaincheck
from suspiciousurl import assessing_risk_scores

# Test with sample email content
email_content = """From: suspicious@new-domain.com
Subject: Urgent: Win $1000 now!
Click here for free money: http://suspicious-site.com/claim"""

# Parse email components
title, subject, body = parse_email_file(email_content)

# Run individual detection components
classification, keywords, keywords_score = classify_email(subject, body)
domain_msg, domain_score = domaincheck(title)
url_reasons, url_score = assessing_risk_scores(body)

# Calculate total risk
total_score = keywords_score + domain_score + url_score

print(f"Classification: {classification}")
print(f"Keyword Score: {keywords_score}")
print(f"Domain Score: {domain_score}")
print(f"URL Score: {url_score}")
print(f"Total Risk Score: {total_score}")
print(f"Keywords found: {keywords}")
print(f"Domain analysis: {domain_msg}")
print(f"URL analysis: {url_reasons}")
```

#### Using Main Pipeline
```python
from main import process_email_file

# Test with email file
email_file = "dataset/testing/spam_1.txt"
process_email_file(email_file)
```

### Comparing Detectors
```bash
python detector_comparison.py
```
This will test both detectors on all sample emails and generate a comparison report.

### Additional Analysis Tools

#### URL Analysis
```bash
python suspiciousurl.py
```
Analyzes URLs in emails for suspicious characteristics including domain reputation, URL shorteners, and phishing indicators.

#### CSV Data Processing
```bash
python csv_processor.py
```
Processes CSV keyword files and integrates them into JSON detection rules.

#### Word Frequency Analysis
```bash
python word_frequency_analyzer.py
```
Analyzes word frequency patterns in email datasets for keyword extraction.

#### Main Integration Script
```bash
python main.py
```
Integrates multiple detection components including URL analysis and keyword detection.

### Updating Spam Keywords Database

#### Scrape New Keywords
```bash
python spamwords.py
```
This will scrape the latest spam keywords and update `words/spam_words.txt`.

#### Categorize Keywords into Rules
```bash
python keyword_categorizer.py
```
This will categorize all keywords and generate `rules/detection_rules.json`.

### Testing with Sample Data

#### Run Complete Test Suite
```bash
python test_hybrid_terminal.py
```
This runs comprehensive tests comparing both detection systems on all sample files.

#### Quick Spam File Testing
```bash
python test_spam_files.py
```
Tests enhanced detector with files in the ham/ directory.

#### Manual Testing
The detectfunction.py file includes a main block that can test email files directly:
- Edit the file path in detectfunction.py to specify test file
- Supports both .txt and .eml file formats
- Run with: `python detectfunction.py`
