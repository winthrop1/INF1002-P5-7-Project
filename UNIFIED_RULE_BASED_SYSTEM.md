## 1. Intelligent Rule System

### 1.1 Rule Categories and Weights

The system categorizes phishing indicators into distinct categories, each with specific weight multipliers:

| Category | Weight Multiplier | Description | Priority |
|----------|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Financial | 1.5x | Money transfers, banking, payments | High |
| Social Engineering | 2.0x | Manipulation tactics, trust exploitation | Critical |
| Authority | 1.7x | Impersonation of officials/executives | High |
| Urgency | 1.8x | Time pressure, immediate action required | High |
| Technical | 1.2x | URLs, domains, technical indicators | Medium |
| Offers | 1.2x | Suspicious deals, promotions | Low |
| General | 1.0x | Uncategorized spam indicators | Low |

### 1.2 Rule Structure

Each rule contains:
- **Unique ID**: Category-based identification (e.g., FIN_001, SOC_002)
- **Pattern Matching**: Keywords, regex patterns, or combinations
- **Context Awareness**: Subject, body, sender, URLs, attachments
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Base weight × category multiplier × context weight
- **Metadata**: Description, examples, creation date, source

### 1.3 Scoring Tiers

| Risk Level | Score Range | Action | Visual Indicator | Response |
|------------|-------------|--------|------------------|----------|
| CRITICAL | 9.0-10.0 | BLOCK | Red | Immediate blocking and quarantine |
| HIGH | 7.0-8.9 | QUARANTINE | Orange | Quarantine for manual review |
| MEDIUM | 4.0-6.9 | FLAG | Yellow | Flag for user awareness |
| LOW | 1.0-3.9 | LOG | Blue | Log for pattern analysis |
| SAFE | 0.0-0.9 | ALLOW | Green | Normal delivery |

## 2. Web Scraper Integration

### 2.1 Automated Rule Generation Pipeline

    A[Web Sources] --> B[Scraper]
    B --> C[Keyword Extraction]
    C --> D[Quality Filtering]
    D --> E[Categorization]
    E --> F[Rule Generation]
    F --> G[Validation]
    G --> H[Integration]
    H --> I[Detection System]
```

### 2.2 Enhanced Scraper Features

#### Multi-Source Scraping
- **Primary Sources**: ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, MailChimp
- **Custom Lists**: Organization-specific keywords
- **API Integration**: Threat intelligence feeds
- **Community Sources**: Shared phishing indicators

#### Intelligent Categorization
The scraper automatically categorizes keywords based on content analysis:

```python
# Automatic categorization logic
Financial: "money", "transfer", "bank", "payment"
Urgency: "urgent", "immediate", "expires", "deadline"
Authority: "CEO", "manager", "government", "official"
Social: "verify", "confirm", "update", "suspend"
```

#### Quality Scoring
Keywords are scored based on:
- **Specificity**: Specific phrases score higher than generic words
- **Length**: 2-4 word phrases are optimal
- **Patterns**: Known spam patterns increase score
- **Frequency**: Common phishing terms weighted higher

### 2.3 Update Scheduling

| Update Type | Frequency | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Automatic | Weekly | Scheduled | Regular rule refresh |
| Manual | On-demand | Admin action | Immediate threat response |
| Event-driven | Real-time | New threat detected | Rapid response |
| Batch | Daily | Overnight | Performance optimization |

## 3. Detection Engine Components

### 3.1 Enhanced Detector (enhanced_detector.py)

**Primary Functions:**
- Orchestrates all detection components
- Manages rule evaluation pipeline
- Aggregates scores from multiple analyzers
- Generates comprehensive analysis reports

**Key Methods:**
```python
analyze_email(email_content) -> Dict[Analysis]
evaluate_rules(parsed_email, rules) -> List[RuleMatch]
calculate_risk_score(matches) -> RiskAssessment
generate_recommendations(risk_level) -> List[Action]
```

### 3.2 Pattern Matcher (pattern_matcher.py)

**Matching Capabilities:**
- **Keyword Matching**: Exact and fuzzy matching with word boundaries
- **Regex Patterns**: Complex pattern detection
- **Combination Logic**: AND/OR keyword combinations
- **Context Extraction**: Surrounding text for matched patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Compiled pattern caching

### 3.3 Scoring Engine (scoring_engine.py)

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Final Score = Σ(Rule Weight × Category Multiplier × Context Weight)
Confidence = min(Base Score / 10 + Rule Count × 0.1, 1.0)
Risk Level = Scoring Tier based on Final Score
```

### 3.4 Email Parser (utils/email_parser.py)

**Extraction Capabilities:**
- Headers (Subject, From, To, Reply-To)
- Body content (Plain text and HTML)
- URLs and domains
- Attachments metadata
- Email structure analysis

### 3.5 Domain Analyzer (utils/domain_analyzer.py)

**Analysis Features:**
- Domain spoofing detection (typosquatting, homoglyphs)
- Suspicious TLD identification
- URL shortener detection
- IP address vs domain analysis
- Domain reputation checking
